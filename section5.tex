\begin{slide}{Partial Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The formulation is straightforward, optimization based and extendable.
    \item The graininess \(\mu\) can change randomly to avoid attack vectors
          which may also affect the time-scale system. Better yet, techniques as
          the Game Theory's Moving Target can give the best strategies to
          changing its value.
    \item A future work may try to find bounds for the complex-valued poles.
    \item The next step is to make a Functional-Time-Scale observer, and/or a
          distributed one.
  \end{itemize}
