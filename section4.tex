\begin{slide}{Final Considerations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The formulation is straightforward, optimization based and extendable.
    \item The example was a simple system for didactic reasons, but this kind of
          observer is better suited for large, sparse systems.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Works Perspective}%
\label{subsec:future-works}

\begin{slide}{Future Works Perspective}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Extend to detect Dynamic False Data Injection attacks.
    \item Discrete-time version.
    \item Use with other techniques to detect other types of attacks.
  \end{itemize}
