\subsection{Final Considerations}%
\label{subsec:conclusion}

\begin{slide}{Final Considerations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The proposed technique can accelerate the overall convergence of
          constrained switched systems.
    \item The hybrid switch allows to switch controllers earlier, resulting in
          better performance.
    \item Probably requires the design of new controllers.
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\subsection{Future Works Perspective}%
\label{subsec:future-works}

\begin{slide}{Future Works Perspective}
  Extend the technique to
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Model with uncertainties,
    \item LPV subsystems,
    \item Non-constrained systems.
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}
